## Problem

When Akın Kaldıroğlu was a grad student at Purdue University, they used to use several different
software packages for example for VLSI design or C++ programming running on Sun/HP
workstations. And they were licensed for the use of limited number of concurrent
users. When the concurrent number of users reached the limit for a software package
then new users couldn't run it at all and were notified that all of the licenses
have all been taken up and retry later. Now here is the problem: **How can you implement
such a license mechanism so that no change to either in software package or client
machines would be necessary. Design and implement your solution using proxy design
pattern. Implement your own error mechanism to represent the case where no license
is available.**

## Personal Opinion

I am aware that there are deficiencies in my solution method and that my code is insufficient to meet the requirements.
Since our time was limited, I could not obtain sufficient research results to solve the problem.
I will make the arrangements as soon as possible and try to make it a good license mechanism.
